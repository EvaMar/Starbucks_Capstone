    "# Starbucks Capstone Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For this challenge, Starbucks has provided simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. Not all users receive the same offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starburks interest is to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. You'll see in the data set that informational offers have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, you can assume the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data provided:\n",
    "portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)  \n",
    "profile.json - demographic data for each customer  \n",
    "transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed"
   ]
  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to use \"what worked in the past\" to send the same \"successful\" offer to similar profile users.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Demographics and spending behaviours will define the profile of a user.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The grade of \"success\" of an offer will be define as following:\n",
    "1. Offer has been visualised and completed - greatest level of success\n",
    "1. Offer hasn't been sent to the customer at all - if any other offer \"failed\" (see points below) the best we can do for the same type of user is to sent an offer that hasn't been sent before. The worst thing it will happen, it will increase the knowledge of success/fail in our database and the model will be more accurate in the next run\n",
    "1. If a customer has seen the offer but did not complete it, or he/she hasn't either visualise or complete the offer or - worst scenario for Starbucks - has used the offer without visualising it (causing losing of revenue), those will all be considered a \"fail\" and probably we would not like to suggest those offer to similar user in future\n",
    "1. If a profile has receive ALL types of offer and they are all a \"fail\" then probably that type of user just want to be left alone. The best reccomandation is probably Offer 0, meaning do not sent any offer to them  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "I will use Decision Tree to define the \"profile\". The reason I chose this model is because it will automatically pick up the right relevant range of income/spending behaviour and incorporate them with demographics. \n"

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "We have experimented the use of a combination of decision tree and success scoring to identify the best offer based on demographics like age, membership lenght, income, gender and average transaction amount. \n",
    "In order to challenge our choise of model, we had compared it against a different classification model, the K-Nearest Neighbors, obtaining a similar results in term of accuracy, F1, Recall and precision both on estimating the model with the training and the test data.  \n",
    "Both models did not shown high accuracy, F1, recall and precision score and both of the models did not improved with their paramenter increase (Minimun samples split for Decision Tree and number of neighbors for the K-Nearest Neighbors).  \n",

    "### Improvements\n",
    "Since both model definatively don't shows signs of overfitting, further experiments with higher number of data and collecting higher number of features could make the model more accurate.   \n",
    "This model was also meant to be \"iterative\" and to learn more every run. Let us remember that if we don't have completed offer for a particular user, we made the best guessing in success based on highest profit and longest duration. Once that user has received the model reccomandation, he/she will determined success/fail, increasing the model's knowledge.  \n",
    "The benefit of this type of model would be to enable reccomandations with no cold start problem and without the necessity to use Funk_SVD, therefore it will be worth to investigate additional features and additional iterations."
